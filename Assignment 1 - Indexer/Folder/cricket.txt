Cricket is a sport that originated in England and is now played worldwide. It is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each. The objective of the game is to score more runs than the opposing team. The game is played on a circular field with a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch in the center. The pitch is divided into two halves, with each half having three stumps and two bails placed on top of them. The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman, who tries to hit it as far as possible while the fielding team tries to catch it or stop it from going too far.

Cricket has evolved over time, and different formats of the game have emerged. The most popular formats are Test cricket, One Day International (ODI) cricket, and Twenty20 (T20) cricket. Test cricket is the oldest format and is played over five days, with each team batting twice. ODI cricket is played over 50 overs per side, while T20 cricket is played over 20 overs per side.

Cricket has a rich history and has produced many legendary players over the years. Some of the most famous cricketers include Sir Don Bradman, Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Babar Azam, Steve Smith, Virat Kholi, Kane Williamson, Joe Root and Jacques Kallis. These players have set numerous records in their careers and have inspired many young cricketers around the world. food
